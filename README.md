# Breast_Cancer_Classification-using-Dense-Neural-Network
This repository contains an end-to-end solution for classifying breast cancer into malignant or benign categories using a Dense Neural Network (DNN). The project leverages deep learning techniques to process breast cancer diagnostic data and predict the nature of a tumor based on its features.
